# Nuclear Energy Overview Dataset Analytics Project

Nuclear energy is one of the most reliable and cleanest source of energy that plays a big role in energy transition and climate change mitigation. Public perception, policy decisions, and operational constraints may contribute to the trends of its utilization over time despite of its capability to have high capacity factor, means that nuclear energy having a high ratio of actual electricity generated to the maximum possible electricity the plant could have produced if it had operated at full power continuously.
